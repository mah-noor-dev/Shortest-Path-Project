🛣️ Shortest Path Project – Dijkstra's Algorithm (C++ & Python)
📌 Overview
This project implements Dijkstra’s Algorithm, one of the most fundamental and widely used algorithms in graph theory for finding the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. The implementation is done in both C++ and Python, providing a cross-language perspective and helping learners understand algorithmic logic independent of syntax.

The project not only demonstrates the standard Dijkstra approach but also focuses on clean structure, efficiency, and practical relevance — making it suitable for academic submissions, interview preparation, and foundational understanding of graph-based problem solving.

🧠 Core Features
🔹 C++ and Python versions side-by-side for comparative learning

🔹 Uses adjacency list representation for graph efficiency

🔹 Priority Queue (Min-Heap) used in Python (heapq) and C++ (STL)

🔹 Supports weighted, undirected graphs

🔹 Clearly separates logic, input handling, and output display

🔹 User-friendly and scalable code for real-world graph sizes

🔍 What is Dijkstra’s Algorithm?
Dijkstra's Algorithm solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights. It uses a greedy approach, selecting the next closest unvisited node at each step, and gradually builds the shortest distance tree from the source node.

The time complexity with a priority queue is:

O((V + E) log V) using Min-Heap (Python heapq / C++ priority_queue)


🛠 Technologies Used
Languages: C++ (STL-based), Python 3

Data Structures: Adjacency lists, Min-heaps / Priority queues

Tools: Any C++ compiler (G++, VS Code), Python 3.x (IDLE, Jupyter, or CLI)
